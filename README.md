This is a simple Todo App that I built referencing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi2xdrpmJNk&t=160s, in order to learn a bit more about Next.js 13, as well as get some practice with TypeScript.

Live at this link: https://todo-app-mu-henna.vercel.app/

Built using json-server as the "database". Database hosted with Render. If the deployment does not work the first time, refresh the page. Render spins down projects with less traffic over time.

Currently only has support for a singular Todo List (i.e. Everyone viewing the link is seeing and editing the same todo list)
